# ðŸ“š Research Recommendation System

This project is a **Research Paper Recommendation System** built using **Streamlit**, designed to help users discover the most relevant research papers based on a topic query. It fetches real-time papers from **arXiv** and ranks them using different **NLP-based similarity models**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ”Ž **Search for research papers** by topic or keywords.
- ðŸ§  Choose from multiple **text similarity models**:
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)
  - BOW (Bag of Words)
  - Word2Vec
  - Hashing Vectorizer
  - SBERT (Sentence-BERT for semantic similarity)
- ðŸ§¾ Get a list of **recommended papers**, including:
  - Title (linked to arXiv)
  - Author(s)
  - Published date
  - Abstract summary
  - Relevance score based on the selected model

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend/NLP:** scikit-learn, gensim (Word2Vec), sentence-transformers (SBERT)
- **Data Source:** arXiv API (via XML)

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. User inputs a research topic.
2. The app fetches relevant papers from arXiv.
3. Summaries are vectorized based on the selected NLP model.
4. Cosine similarity is computed between the query and paper summaries.
5. Papers are ranked and displayed by relevance.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-recommendation-system.git
cd research-recommendation-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
